How We Met</b><i><br>
<br>
</i>Actually, we can't quite remember how we
"met."&nbsp; We have several mutual friends, and we think we may
have first met at a dinner party hosted by Jen and Bonnie... but we're
not sure.&nbsp; Whenever it was, obviously, our first meeting was
not exactly memorable, and despite running into each other a few times
over the course of about a year, we never really bothered to talk.</font>
<p> <font color="#3a4b34">Apparently, another
thing that was not exactly memorable was Robyn's name.&nbsp; "Shiny
Shirt Dan" is a Gainesville legend, and so Robyn had no trouble with
his name, but after running into Dan at Speakeasy (a local bar) more
than a few times, Robyn realized he had no idea what her name actually
was.&nbsp; When she asked Dan about this, the best he muster was,
"Of course I know your name... you're the <a target="_blank" href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/teachingmath/html/enlarge/2001_9284.htm">
little professor</a>."&nbsp; When pushed to guess her name,
he guessed, "Audrey."</font></p>
<p><font color="#3a4b34">A week later, Robyn
and Jen saw Dan at Speakeasy -- again -- and they asked if he
remembered Robyn's name.&nbsp; Jen gave a multiple-choice quiz,
asking if the name was Susie, Audrey, or Robyn.&nbsp; Dan said,
"Audrey, that's right! It's Audrey!"</font></p>
<p><font color="#3a4b34">When Dan started
asking people about Audrey the next day (July 4, 2004), all he got were
puzzled looks.&nbsp; He asked Jen for Audrey's number, and she
happily obliged, but when Audrey's voicemail said "Hi, this is
Robyn...", he began to catch on.&nbsp; Robyn listened to her
voicemail later that night, and she laughed as Dan expressed his dismay
that Audrey had been lying all this time.</font></p>
<p><font color="#3a4b34">That voicemail led to
repeated phone conversations, emails, and finally, a first date on July
18, 2004.&nbsp; Dan was pretty sure of the name by then, though
sometimes he still wonders.</font></p>
<p> <font color="#3a4b34"><b>How We Got
Engaged</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#3a4b34">Robyn was facing a
rather monumental birthday on July 15th, and Dan told her that he was
taking her "somewhere within driving distance" for her birthday
weekend.&nbsp; That "somewhere"&nbsp; turned out to be the Ritz
Carlton on Amelia Island, which is a small, secluded barrier island
just north of Jacksonville. </font></p>
<p><font color="#3a4b34">Dan told Robyn that
the dinner reservations were for 8:30, and right before dinner, he
suggested she open one of her birthday&nbsp; presents.&nbsp; He
said, though, that the present came with a preamble, and before she
knew it, he was down on one knee with a ring, asking her to marry
him!&nbsp; She said "of course."&nbsp; Dinner reservations were
actually for 9:00pm, so Robyn had time to call her parents, who knew
about all of this ahead of time and who were waiting by the
phone.&nbsp; We also had time to stop by the concierge, who helped
us devise a way to make the ring fit!</font></p>
<p><font color="#3a4b34">We spent the rest of
the weekend enjoying the beach, getting terribly sunburned, and using
the ring to get free champagne out of the Ritz Carlton's staff.</font></p>

<p> <font color="#3a4b34"><b>About Robyn</b><i><br>
<br>
</i>Robyn was born near New Orleans, but she grew up in
Erie, Pennsylvania and then York, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; She went to
American University (in Washington, DC), and then received her PhD in
psychology from Princeton University (in New
Jersey).&nbsp;&nbsp; She moved to Gainesville right after
graduate school, and she currently teaches (and researches) consumer
psychology in the marketing department of the University of Florida
(hence, Dan's attempt to call her the "little
professor").&nbsp;&nbsp; Robyn roots for the Gators when in
Gainesville, but she must confess that she cheers on LSU and the
hapless Saints out of a sense of family loyalty.&nbsp; Strangely,
Robyn, not Dan, is the one who is involved in several fantasy football
leagues.</font></p>

<p> <font color="#3a4b34">Dan was born in
Silver Springs, Maryland, but he moved to Cape Coral, Florida when he
was ten.&nbsp; He moved to Gainesville to attend the University of
Florida ... let's just say "many" ... years ago, and he forgot to
leave.&nbsp; Dan graduated from UF with a degree in industrial
engineering and also an MBA.&nbsp; He is part-owner of a human
resources software company, </font> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mindsolve.com"> <font color="#3a4b34">MindSolve</font></a><font color="#3a4b34">.&nbsp; No one really seems to know what
they do other than "something with computers."&nbsp; Although Dan
isn't much of the sports fan (having never watched a regular season NFL
or NBA game), he does a pretty good job of religiously tailgating for
the Gators.&nbsp; Dan also enjoys, and is nationally-famous for, <a target="_blank" href="images/ShirtAtSpeakWeb.jpg">wearing
